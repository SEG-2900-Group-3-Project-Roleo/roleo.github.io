              <h2>Why We Started</h2>
              <p>
                The idea for Roleo was born out of a shared frustration. We noticed how outdated and overwhelming the job application process had become: endless forms, repetitive uploads, and a lack of feedback. Meanwhile, dating apps had mastered the art of quick, intuitive matching. We thought: <em>what if finding a job could be just as seamless?</em><br />That question led us to build this website, Roleo, that blends the simplicity of swiping with the power of smart job discovery.
