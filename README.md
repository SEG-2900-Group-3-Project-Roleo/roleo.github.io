Product Name: Roleo

Product Description: A tinder-like mobile and desktopp app where a user can find job openings/potential employers by swiping left (no) or right (yes). The employer will get the resume of the potential employee and the employee will get the overview of the employer. Once matched, the two can go further in a conversation leading into a interview. Roleo, just one swipe away from success.
